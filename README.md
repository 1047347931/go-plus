# go-plus â€“ Improved Go Experience In Atom

This package adds `gofmt` support when editing Go files in Atom. If you prefer,
you can use `goimports` as a substitute for `gofmt` by updating the preferences
for this package.

Additional features will be added to this package:

* `go build` and `go test` integration to enhance error display
* Status bar text for errors
* `gocode` integration
* ... and others: https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus/issues
